# SUFC - Football Analytics Project
Sheffield United Technical Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains football analytics tools and notebooks focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and recruitment analysis, with a particular emphasis on evaluating right-back positions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Charlie592/SUFC.git
cd SUFC
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Starting Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Analysis Focus Areas

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA notebook (`01_analysis.ipynb`) covers:
- **Data Overview**: Dataset structure, features, and summary statistics
- **Missing Data Analysis**: Identifying and handling missing values
- **Distribution Analysis**: Understanding the distribution of key metrics (defensive actions, passing accuracy, physical attributes)
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between different player attributes
- **Position-Specific Insights**: Comparing right-backs against other positions
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Identifying outliers and data inconsistencies

### 2. Right-Back Recruitment Analysis
The recruitment methodology (`02_rightback_recruitment.ipynb`) ranks RB/RWB candidates for a Wilder-style 3-5-2/5-3-2 via:
- **Eligibility cohort**: Position in {DR, DMR} and minutes ≥ 1000
- **Per90 creation**: Only on counting stats; safe divide-by-zero handling
- **League-aware standardisation**: Z-scores by league for all pillar metrics
- **Pillars**: Build-up, Creation, Defending (mean of available z-scores)
- **Overall + bonuses**: Weighted pillars plus small age/minutes bonuses
- **Feasibility overlay**: Market value, contract, GBE → practicality score
- **Priority score**: Recruitment_Score × Feasibility_Score
- **Risk flags**: Heuristics to annotate profiles (e.g., cross volume vs efficiency)
- **Outputs**: Top-N shortlist CSV at `./outputs/shortlist.csv` and bar chart
- **Sensitivity**: Re-rank under ±10% weight shifts to check robustness
